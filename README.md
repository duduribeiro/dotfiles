# Dotfiles

## Usage

### iTerm + zsh

You should import the keymap `iterm2-better-key-travel.itermkeymap` on iTerm

`CMD + Option + [Arrow]`: Navigate between words in terminal

`CTRL + r`: Fzf find files

`CTRL + r` Fzf navigate in history

### tmux

`Ctrl+s` is the prefix. I suggest remap the Caps lock key to act as CTRL. With this pressing the prefix will be easier.

`Ctrl+s, r`: Reload any config change on .tmux.conf

`Ctrl+s, \`: Split window horizontally
`Ctrl+s, -`: Split window vertically
